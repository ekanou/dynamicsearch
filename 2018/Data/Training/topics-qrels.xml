			<description>Hurricane Katrina, the most costly hurricane ever, effected millions of people and in its wake thye Bush administration and federal government drew sharp criticism for its response.</description>
			<narrative>Relevant documents report on how Hurricane Katrina, the most expensive such storm in history, sent more than 100,00 fleeing to shelters and destroyed more than 400,000 homes and damaged an additional 200,000. Insurers ended up paying out nearly $100 million in lawsuits filed by storm victims. The victims, the general public and even congressional Republicans as well as Democrats were highly critical about he speed and thoroughness with which FEMA and the Bush administration reacted to the storms's aftermath to help those displaced by the hurricane. President Bush later took responsibility for the failure to react promptly and effectively to aid the vicitims.</narrative>

					<text><![CDATA[A federal judge in Mississippi sided with home insurance companies yesterday and ruled that they did not have to pay for the flooding that destroyed tens of thousands of homes in Hurricane Katrina. Insurers have already paid $17.6 billion for damage to homes from Katrina that was attributed to wind only. But this was a victory for the companies, because they could have been forced to pay out untold billions more if they had been required to cover damage from flooding caused by the storm. Several hundred thousand homes were damaged or destroyed by Katrina]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Since Hurricane Katrina, the Internal Revenue Service has used a fast-track approval process to grant tax exemptions to almost 400 new charities that said they planned to assist the disaster's victims. But one that distributes leather jackets to address the special needs of sadomasochists? Another that hands out new underwear? Critics were opposed to the expedited process before it began, warning that many of the upstart organizations would have short shelf lives, prove difficult to track and monitor, and suck money away from more experienced organizations offering support and services. That is precisely what happened in many cases in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A spot check of the new Hurricane Katrina charities shows that some have indeed disappeared, while others are struggling to help storm victims or to broaden their mission after an initial spurt of activity. Over all, about $3.6 billion has been pledged to Hurricane Katrina-related charities, with roughly 60 percent donated to the American Red]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Hurricane Katrina pounded the Gulf Coast with devastating force at daybreak on Monday, sparing New Orleans the catastrophic hit that had been feared but inundating parts of the city and heaping damage on neighboring Mississippi, where it killed dozens, ripped away roofs and left coastal roads impassable. Officials said that according to preliminary reports, there were at least 55 deaths, with 50 alone in Harrison County, Miss., which includes Gulfport and Biloxi. Emergency workers feared that they would find more dead among people who had been trapped in their homes and in collapsed buildings. Jim Pollard, a spokesman for the Harrison County emergency operations center, said many of the dead were found in an apartment complex in Biloxi. Seven others were found in the Industrial Seaway. Packing 145-mile-an-hour winds as it made landfall, the storm left more than a million people in three states without power and submerged highways even hundreds of miles from its center. The storm was potent enough to rank as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the United States. Insurance experts said that damage could exceed $9 billion, which would make it one of the costliest storms on record.]]></text>

With bridges washed out, highways converted into canals, and power and communications lines inoperable, government officials ordered everyone still remaining out of the city. Officials began planning for the evacuation of the Superdome, where about 10,000 refugees huddled in increasingly grim conditions as water and food were running out and rising water threatened the generators.]]></text>

The airport formally reopened for cargo traffic on Sunday. By Tuesday, the airport hopes to have 30 daily departures and arrivals of passenger flights -- down from 174 before the storm -- and 60 each day by the end of October. The Port of New Orleans planned to reopen its container terminal on Wednesday. The port has 12 damaged wharfs and one wharf that is inaccessible because of flooding. And at the 17th Street Canal, where the eastern levee wall partly collapsed after the storm, flooding most of the city, heavy equipment rolled across the concrete and stone that sealed the sandbags temporarily plugging the 300-foot breach. Six of the 15 pumps at Pumping Station No.6, which is at the canal and is one of the city's largest pumps, were working on Sunday.]]></text>

Entergy says many underground conduits are designed to survive flooding, but some experts are skeptical that the lines will survive weeks under the brackish water. Transformers are soaked. Debris will have to be cleaned out of them and electronic parts replaced. Utilities have extensive mutual-aid agreements, but weeks of work remain. Once the distribution system is restored, inspectors will have to check the wiring of each home and building. ''It's kind of like a house-to-house battle,'' said Jeffrey Corbett, vice president for distribution of Progress Energy, a utility based in Raleigh, N.C. New Orleans will not be habitable by a large population until it has a water supply and a functioning sewer system. Sewage treatment tends to be the last thing back on line after a flood, because plants are at the lowest point in the city and thus under the deepest water.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[But most of New Orleans was not flooded by water coming directly from the Gulf. It was flooded from the north and rear by Lake Pontchartrain, when levees failed along the 17th Street and London Avenue drainage canals. Initially, the Corps of Engineers said that the storm was so great that it overtopped these levees also. But after inspecting the levees and reviewing storm data, all three investigating teams agree: Hurricane Katrina hit Lake Pontchartrain with far less strength than it did the Gulf Coast, and the storm surge fell well short of the tops of the levees. In fact, a design or construction flaw caused them to collapse in the face of a force they were designed to hold. In other words, if the levees had performed as they were supposed to, the deaths in New Orleans proper, the scenes in the Superdome and the city's devastation would never have taken place.]]></text>

In adjacent St. Bernard Parish, which was particularly hard hit, 99 percent of homes and businesses remained without power, Mr. Field said. In Orleans Parish, that figure was 89 percent, and in Jefferson Parish, just over 50 percent. As floodwaters recede north toward Lake Pontchartrain, water levels across the city have fallen as much as four feet since Monday. Parts of Interstate 10 that had been flooded are passable, and the city's downtown core is mostly dry. On Canal Street, a major commercial artery where many news organizations are working out of recreational vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel fuel, some hotels prepared to reopen. Businesses, including some clothing stores, sent employees to inspect their properties.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[The levees, which provide a tenuous barrier between the city and the waters that surround most of it, have long had many weak spots and were not designed to withstand the full force of a storm like Hurricane Katrina. Both major breaches took place along canals built in decades past as conduits for commerce, Army Corps officials said. The other failure occurred along the Industrial Canal, an 80-year-old channel that had been identified as a weak spot in computer simulations of storm surges from hypothetical hurricanes. Mr. Hall said that as the surge from the storm swept in through Lake Pontchartrain -- actually a broad inlet off the gulf -- it began sloshing over the vertical steel and concrete wall and the earthen berm behind it. ''Once it got over, it began to scour down at the base of that flood wall on the protected side,'' he said. The rising waters in the canal pushed in on the high part of the retaining wall while water cascading over the top ate away at the base, Mr. Hall said, adding: ''The effect is like a high-low tackle in football. You hit the head and feet at the same time from opposite directions, and it goes down.'']]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Since Hurricane Katrina hit, billions of dollars in federal aid has poured into the devastated areas of Mississippi and Louisiana, primarily for the most critical emergency needs: providing temporary housing, restarting governments and cleaning up the mountains of debris. On Sunday, leaders in the House and Senate moved to switch from a relief effort to recovery, agreeing to appropriate large chunks of money to rebuild the region and, at least in part, to bail out some of the tens of thousands of people who were financially devastated by the storm. The recovery package allocates $11.5 billion in new grant money, mostly for Mississippi and Louisiana. State officials have indicated they intend to use much of it to compensate some of the estimated 110,000 families whose homes were flooded by Hurricane Katrina but who did not have flood insurance. The deal also includes $2.68 billion to strengthen the levees, protect the watershed and take other flood-control measures around New Orleans and elsewhere on the Gulf Coast. There is $2.75 billion to reimburse states for highway repairs.]]></text>

The additional money, voted by the Senate Appropriations Committee, means that Louisiana will most likely retain all of the $4.2 billion that the House approved for home rebuilding. Texas and Mississippi had been expected to vie for a share of those funds, but the provisions adopted by the committee yesterday, adding about $8 billion in hurricane relief that would also help other programs and states, heads off such a battle.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[It took weeks of crunching data, crossing fingers and lobbying in Washington. But Louisiana officials and the Bush administration succeeded yesterday in persuading the House to approve $4.2 billion in hurricane relief that state officials say is crucial to their effort to rebuild houses and apartments ruined by last year's storms. The House did not require that all this money be spent in Louisiana, as the state's delegation and the White House had urged, leaving state officials concerned that some of the money might be claimed by Mississippi or Texas. But before voting 348 to 71 to spend the money, the House beat back continuing efforts by conservative Republicans to eliminate all of the $19 billion of hurricane spending from the $92 billion emergency supplemental spending bill, which also includes large sums to pay for the war in Iraq. These lawmakers, trying to curb government spending, have also raised concerns that the hurricane money is not being spent wisely.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Nearly three weeks after Hurricane Katrina cut its devastating path, FEMA -- the same federal agency that botched the rescue mission -- is faltering in its effort to aid hundreds of thousands of storm victims, local officials, evacuees and top federal relief officials say. The federal aid hot line mentioned by President Bush in his address to the nation on Thursday cannot handle the flood of calls, leaving thousands of people unable to get through for help, day after day. Federal officials are often unable to give local governments permission to proceed with fundamental tasks to get their towns running again. Most areas in the region still lack federal help centers, the one-stop shopping sites for residents in need of aid for their homes or families. Officials say that they are uncertain whether they can meet the president's goal of providing housing for 100,000 people who are now in shelters by the middle of next month. While the agency has redoubled its efforts to get food, money and temporary shelter to the storm victims, serious problems remain throughout the affected region. Visits to several towns in Louisiana and Mississippi, as well as interviews with dozens of local and federal officials, provide a portrait of a fragmented and dysfunctional system.]]></text>

''A pretty darn good job,'' is the way Mr. Brown scored his work at FEMA as he was fed a steady stream of softball questions by Republicans. The postmortem hearing was clearly designed to shield the Bush White House from any whiff of culpability. According to Mr. Brown's self-serving tale, the heart of the mismanagement of Katrina was that officials in Baton Rouge and New Orleans were too ''dysfunctional'' for their part of the challenge]]></text>

In the videoconference held at noon on Monday, Aug. 29, Michael D. Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, reported that he had spoken with President Bush twice in the morning and that the president was asking about reports that the levees had been breached. But asked about the levees by Joe Hagin, the White House deputy chief of staff, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana said, ''We have not breached the levee at this point in time.'' She said ''that could change'' and noted that the floodwaters in some areas in and around New Orleans were 8 to 10 feet deep. Later that night, FEMA notified the White House that the levees had been breached.]]></text>

Louisiana and Mississippi politicians said it was a first step in helping rebuild an area in which neighborhoods and whole towns remain wiped out, though the money is largely a reshuffling of the $62 billion that Congress set aside shortly after the hurricane. Most critically, the package gives the two states wide latitude to spend an $11.5 billion community development block grant on a variety of projects, including help for people whose houses were destroyed. On Friday, Mississippi made plans to use the money for $150,000 outlays to 30,000 homeowners whose houses were flooded but who lacked flood insurance because they lived outside the flood plain. Louisiana has 70,000 homeowners in the same situation, and many more ruined houses over all than Mississippi. Its share of the block grant will not go nearly as far in compensating homeowners.]]></text>

At the increasingly unsanitary convention center, crowds swelled to about 25,000 and desperate refugees clamored for food, water and attention while dead bodies, slumped in wheelchairs or wrapped in sheets, lay in their midst. ''Some people there have not eaten or drunk water for three or four days, which is inexcusable,'' acknowledged Joseph W. Matthews, the director of the city's Office of Emergency Preparedness. ''We need additional troops, food, water,'' Mr. Matthews begged, ''and we need personnel, law enforcement. This has turned into a situation where the city is being run by thugs.'' Three days after the hurricane hit, bringing widespread destruction to the Gulf Coast and ruinous floods to low-lying New Orleans, the White House said President Bush would tour the region on Friday. Citing the magnitude of the disaster, federal officials defended their response so far and pledged that more help was coming. The Army Corps of Engineers continued work to close a levee breach that allowed water from Lake Pontchartrain to pour into New Orleans. The effects of the disaster spilled out over the country. In Houston, the city began to grapple with the logistics of taking tens of thousands of refugees into the Astrodome. American Red Cross officials said late Thursday night that the Astrodome was full after accepting more than 11,000 refugees and that evacuees were being sent to other shelters in the Houston area.]]></text>

A preliminary assessment from the oyster industry, one of Louisiana's flourishing seafood businesses, found that while the western side of the state fared well, everything east of Bayou Lafourche to the Mississippi line was ruined. The area accounts for two-thirds of the state's oyster harvesting, or $181 million a year. With federal aid, officials said, it could take two to three years for the crop to return. The frenzied pursuit of gasoline by motorists in the region did not slacken, and disruptions of routines continued. In Georgia, schools in Hancock County were closed on Thursday because of a gasoline shortage. Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia signed an executive order temporarily halting state collection of all motor fuel taxes, effective after midnight Friday. This should reduce gas prices by about 15 cents a gallon.

The fears changed troop deployments, delayed medical evacuations, drove police officers to quit, grounded helicopters. Edwin P. Compass III, the police superintendent, said that tourists -- the core of the city's economy -- were being robbed and raped on streets that had slid into anarchy. The mass misery in the city's two unlit and uncooled primary shelters, the convention center and the Superdome, was compounded, officials said, by gangs that were raping women and children. A month later, a review of the available evidence now shows that some, though not all, of the most alarming stories that coursed through the city appear to be little more than figments of frightened imaginations, the product of chaotic circumstances that included no reliable communications, and perhaps the residue of the longstanding raw relations between some police officers and members of the public.]]></text>

			<description>Led by California, homeowners in other parts of the nation began to embrace solar power in increasing numbers after the year 2000.</description>
			<narrative>American homeowners bought into solar energy in greater numbers as the year 2000 turned into 2001. In the past, after President Reagan removed the green energy tax credit as oil prices dropped in the mid 1980s, the price of solar rose markedly and demand dropped. But a new surge in oil prices in oil prices shortly after 2000 convinced many homeowners to go solar.</narrative>

And it still makes no economic sense. You might want photovoltaic solar panels to generate your own electricity out of a belief that you will save the planet. But, as is the case with hybrid vehicles, you certainly should not do it to save money. An online calculator (www.findsolar.com/index.php?page=rightforme) created by solar power advocates and the Department of Energy demonstrates just how hard it is to justify the switch. For instance, a homeowner in New Jersey whose electric bill is an above-average $100 a month could buy a system for about $54,000, it says. After the state rebate of $18,468 and the $2,000 federal tax credit, the system would cost $33,532. And how many years will it take before you see any savings? From 11 to 22 years. The average payback is 14 years, said Polly N. Shaw, a senior regulatory analyst with the California Public Utilities Commission.]]></text>

In bald financial terms, power made with fossil fuel or nuclear power remains much cheaper than using backyard sun to power hot water and electricity. One energy consultant, Joel Gordes who runs Environmental Energy Solutions in Colebrook, estimates that solar electrical systems provide $140 worth of electricity per year. Then there is the cost of the equipment itself. For a typical house, the photovoltaic panels and related equipment for electricity, combined with the solar hot-water equipment, cost about $35,000. This means that owners of solar systems will recoup their investments between 15 and 20 years after these systems go on line.]]></text>

''The program targets the lower-income population because it is focusing on those who are not able to make energy-efficient improvements to their home that would lower their electric bill,'' Mr. Zaweski said. Under the program, the total cost of a household's improvements is capped at $10,000. To qualify, applicants must fall within the required income guidelines and reside in homes that they own.

The carrot is the falling cost of solar systems that are lighter and more efficient and feature new designs, like solar panels that double as window awnings. Standardized installations and economies of scale for equipment production have helped drive costs lower. In moving toward the energy mainstream, solar expenses have dropped to around $8 a watt, from roughly $100 three decades ago; the cost is even less if a system is installed as part of a new home's construction. In either case, that puts the price of a system that can reduce electric bills significantly -- like a three-kilowatt system -- in the $20,000 range. That's still a lot of money, but buyers may be able to get a lot of it back immediately, through government incentives. And with energy prices rising, the payback period for the rest is getting steadily shorter.]]></text>

I make all of my electricity and store it in batteries -- enough to run lights, a computer, fax, power tools, a water pump. The latest estimate is that California's failed experiment with deregulation will cost consumers $5 billion annually in increased rates. Watching the sun glint off my solar panels, I was moved to find out how many of them could be purchased for $1 billion. The answer is about one million 110 watt, 110 volt, utility-ready panels, the easiest kind for consumers to use. (My system uses five panels). At peak power output on a California summer afternoon -- when blackouts are most likely to occur -- those one million panels would produce about 100 megawatts of electricity.]]></text>

As environmentally-conscious citizens with an understandable liking for saving money, the Rouse's installed solar panels on the roof of their home in Hamilton Township, next to Trenton. Not only would they save energy and combat global warning, but they would qualify for a $2,000 credit on their federal income taxes and a significant state subsidy for installing the panels. The stipends are aimed at encouraging energy conservation. But then came a surprise. As reported in The Times of Trenton, a local assessor noticed the newly-installed panels, deemed that they constituted a property improvement, and socked the Rouse's with a $12,000 increased tax assessment. The result is an annual tax hike of at least $500, which in a few years will more than offset the state's subsidy, federal income tax credit and energy savings. The maddening aspect is that the state itself made the higher assessment possible. Solar panels were exempt from property taxes until 1988, but when that exemption expired, Trenton issued an advisory encouraging local assessors to tax them.]]></text>

But several of the nation's leading solar power experts say Enron's optimistic goal is probably reachable. The reason is that during the last decade, the cost of solar power generation has quietly declined by two-thirds. Far from depending on some wondrous breakthrough, the experts say, Enron can offer commercially competitive solar power by inexpensively mass-producing solar panels, and then employing thousands of them in the Nevada desert. Even the most optimistic supporters of solar power have doubted that they would see commercially competitive production until the next century. The Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group in Washington, said earlier this year that solar cell electricity, now as low as 20 cents a kilowatt-hour, might reach 10 cents by 2000 and 4 cents by 2020. Yet Enron is pledging to deliver the electricity at 5.5 cents a kilowatt- hour in about two years. That would beat the average cost of 5.8 cents currently paid by the Government for the electricity it uses. The national average retail price is 8 cents.]]></text>

The initiative meets goals outlined in New Jersey's energy master plan and will be available to all P.S.E.&amp;G. customers by the end of this year, if the State Board of Public Utilities gives its approval. The plan calls for 20 percent of the state's power to be fueled by renewable energy by 2020. New Jersey also provides incentives, including rebates and tax credits, for solar installations. P.S.E.&amp;G. said its program would most likely produce about 30 megawatts of solar power by 2010 -- enough energy to serve about 24,000 homes and, in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to removing 3,700 cars from the road.]]></text>

Sprawling over three-quarters of her balcony is a $17,000 customized solar panel system (the cost was confirmed by a local company called Alternative Power, which worked with Jo to get the system installed) that produces half of the electricity she uses in her home. Jo is the pioneer of low-impact living in Manhattan, the first resident to connect a photovoltaic energy system to the city's electricity grid. Between planning and negotiating with her co-op board, it took Jo two years to get the system installed. ''The solar screens are an absolute expression of what I believe in,'' she beams. ''I am sure it was expensive. I don't know.'' In fact, Jo doesn't even know if the solar panels work, since she can't read the meter. (An examination of her electric bills showed she's paying about $23 per month since the system was installed, compared with the $50 per month she paid last summer.) While she is the first to admit that her efforts are ''minuscule and ineffective,'' Jo says that practical outcomes are not really the point. ''I just do what matters to me,'' she says. Next she's considering what Alternative Power might do with her car. ''Cut out the roof,'' she says, ''and put some panels in, maybe.'']]></text>

In a series of papers published over the last few weeks in the journal Science and The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and in reports that will be presented at a meeting in Toronto in July, scientists are casting important new light on the strange protein fragment, known as beta amyloid, and how a few small errors in protein metabolism may spawn a chain reaction of cell death.

					<text><![CDATA[The latest work strongly suggests that the abnormal accretion of the protein fragments into stiff, rope-like patches throughout the brain is either a seminal event or one of the significant steps in the development of Alzheimer's. Many of the researchers believe that these amyloid plaques destroy the surrounding brain tissue, thereby contributing to memory loss, confusion and other hallmarks of the progressive dementia. Although researchers have known for some time that the plaques accumulate in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, they are now able to track the biochemical stages of their formation. They have gained new clues into the role of the normal protein from which amyloid pieces break off, and they are learning how the presence of just a few protein tatters in the brain may trigger production of beta-amyloid plaques]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[New studies indicate that normal amyloid protein is vital to orchestrating the growth of cells. In a recent issue of Science, investigators at the University of California at Irvine reported evidence that platelets in the blood may release one kind of the protein at the site of a wound to help stimulate cell division and inhibit the activity of degrading enzymes as part of tissue repair. And even newer studies indicate that another type of precursor protein may be able to spur the growth of neurons or their finger-like dendrites, although the results are fiercely debated. The beta-amyloid fragments result from a miscut in the normal clipping of the bigger amyloid protein during its release from cells. In a paper published in last month's Science, Dr. Sangram S. Sisodia, a molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore and his colleagues showed that, under ordinary circumstances, cells secrete about three-quarters of the precursor protein and clip it off in the middle of the final quarter. The shorn protein eventually is freed to perform its task outside the cell]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[More than four million Americans are believed to suffer from Alzheimer's, which can destroy the mind, memory and eventually the personality. The cause is unknown. There is no cure or treatment that can arrest progress of the disease. The main physical clue to the disorder is the presence of deposits of a protein called beta amyloid in the blood vessels and tissues of the brain. In the brain tissues of Alzheimer's patients, the amyloid forms the core of ball-shaped plaques. Aberrant and Abnormal Growth Dr. Dennis J. Selkoe of the Harvard Medical School said the new evidence suggests that Alzheimer's is not solely a degeneration of the brain, but partly a process of aberrant and abnormal growth. Evidence emerging in the past year indicates that amyloid deposition is the earliest stage of the disease.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[many researchers are asking if that old hypothesis is correct. They cite accumulating evidence that memory starts to fail long before brain cells die, and that the disease, with its memory loss, begins as an interruption of the signaling between living and healthy brain cells. If they are right, it may be possible to stop Alzheimer's, and reverse the memory loss, if treatments begin before brain cells die. The new idea is that the disease starts when small clumps of a protein, amyloid, start interrupting signals between nerve cells in the brain. The synapses, where one cell signals another in the brain's intricate circuitry, no longer function. Yet, at this early stage of the disease, researchers say, the nerve cells are still alive and well, and the disease might be halted if the clumps of amyloid could be removed or inactivated. But if the disease continues, brain cells start to die. Dead and dying cells accumulate in heaps in the brain, and the injured brain cannot be made whole.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Consider the consequences of a garbage strike. Trash accumulates, streets are clogged and daily life is disrupted. Eventually, things can come to a standstill. Scientists say that kind of disruption may lie at the heart of a wide array of diseases afflicting millions of Americans. In the brain, researchers say, the result is Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and a slew of other neurodegenerative disorders including the human version of mad cow disease. In the pancreas, it is Type 2 diabetes; in the lungs, cystic fibrosis; in the eyes, cataracts. If the problem develops in a certain blood protein, patients can develop numbness in the fingers or toes, or a mysterious form of heart disease that may affect as many as 4 percent of African-Americans. In these and other diseases, researchers say, there are problems with the body's cellular machinery for making proteins and recycling misshapen proteins. Misfolded proteins build up, like trash clogging an alleyway. Normally, our cellular machinery identifies misshapen proteins, reduces them to their constituent parts and recycles those parts. But when this process goes awry, small numbers of misfolded proteins accumulate into tiny spherical particles inside cells. These particles are so small and soluble that they had escaped detection until very recently, but many researchers now say they may be what actually harms brain cells in Alzheimer's disease and islet cells in Type 2 diabetes and so on. Only later and gradually, however, the spheres stick together, forming tiny rods filaments and much larger fibrils, which in turn accumulate into insoluble deposits of protein called amyloid plaque.]]></text>

The investigators, led by Dr. Leonard F. M. Scinto, of the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard Medical School, and by Dr. Huntington Potter, of Harvard Medical School, report that people with Alzheimer's appear to be exquisitely sensitive to eye drops similar to those that doctors use to dilate the pupils before performing an eye examination. They found that the pupils of people with Alzheimer's dilate in response to an atropine solution that is just one-hundredth the strength needed for dilation. Moreover, the researchers report, people with other brain diseases appear to respond normally to the eye drops. And, they say, they have preliminary evidence that people with Alzheimer's may test positive months before their symptoms become obvious.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[In a study reported last week in the British journal Nature, Dr. John Hardy and colleagues at St. Mary's Hospital in London found that Alzheimer's patients from two unrelated families had a mutation in a gene on chromosome 21 that directs cells to produce amyloid, a crucial nerve cell protein. The discovery indicates that an altered amyloid protein can cause some Alzheimer's cases, and so suggests that fragments of amyloid itself can kill brain cells. But the amyloid gene mutation is not the only cause of Alzheimer's disease. Researchers have found that other families inherit the disease through a gene on chromosome 19. Dr. Alan Roses and his colleagues at the Duke University School of Medicine used genetic markers, landmarks on a chromosome, to find an association between Alzheimer's disease in some families and chromosome 19. Although the researchers have not yet homed in on the gene itself, they know it is different from the gene for amyloid because it is on a different chromosome.]]></text>

Scientists have discovered and cloned the gene for another protein, beta amyloid, which is a major component of the plaques that seem to clog the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Cloning the gene -reproducing it in the laboratory -makes possible detailed studies and complete analysis of the protein, possibly revealing its function. Potentially even more important, scientists have found the approximate location in the human genetic material of a gene that strongly predisposes to the brain disorder in some families. A high research priority is discovery of the gene itself. Analysis of the gene usually discloses the identity of the particular substance that cells make in carrying out the gene's instructions. Identifying such a substance linked to Alzheimer's disease might help reveal underlying causes.]]></text>

And the finding of the defect in Alzheimer's patients but not in healthy individuals indicates that amyloid protein is indeed a cause of the disease.

Altogether, more than a million middle-aged and elderly Americans suffer from Alzheimer's, which results in a devastating mental deterioration that was once simply dismissed as senility. The discovery is especially significant because in the same week four teams of scientists confirmed earlier work isolating the gene that produces amyloid, a protein found in plaques that occur in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

					<text><![CDATA[Less than three months after its discovery of a genetic link to Alzheimer's disease, which turned an entire field on its head, a research team has proposed a radical new theory to explain how inheritance of the gene results in the devastating neurodegenerative disorder. The hypothesis is highly preliminary, based solely on test-tube experiments, and was greeted by other neuroscientists with reactions ranging from measured enthusiasm to outright skepticism. Nevertheless, the results suggest a method for designing drugs to prevent the disease, a common form of dementia that afflicts about four million Americans. The gene is thought to account for the disease in about half those with the disorder, scientists said.]]></text>

This gene too is in the same region of chromosome 21. Whether the amyloid plaques are causes or effects of the disease is not yet known. Conceivably all five groups are studying the same gene. Whether this is true may be determined within the next year. Much Work Lies Ahead]]></text>

The discovery could account for half of all patients with the common neurological disorder, scientists said. It also points the way toward devising treatments to block or at least delay the harrowing and ultimately fatal symptoms of the disease, for which no cure is known. The finding is the first detection of a trait predisposing people toward contracting Alzheimer's after age 65, the time when the great majority of patients come down with it. Other recent reports of genes associated with Alzheimer's disease have not focused on the late-onset variety but instead on the less frequent familial forms of the disorder that strike relatively early in life.]]></text>

Many newspapers ran enthusiastic articles; some even put the news on their front pages, signaling that it was among the most important events of the day. Radio and television programs were even more upbeat, hinting strongly that help was on the way for the four million Americans with Alzheimer's. But the eager reporting raises difficult questions of what to say about medical advances and when to say it. The vaccine itself was exciting. But that news came a year ago in an article in the journal Nature. Scientists then reported they had injected mice with a protein that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients and is thought to lead to the widespread death of brain cells, resulting in symptoms like loss of memory and of the ability to reason and think. Mice do not get the disease, but these animals had been genetically engineered to make large quantities of the aberrant protein, beta amyloid, which accumulated in their brains. When the scientists from Elan Pharmaceuticals in San Francisco gave mice the vaccine, the animals produced antibodies that blocked the accumulation of beta amyloid in their brains, and it even seemed to help clean up some that had already accumulated. It was, in a sense, proof of a principle illustrating that the immune system of mice, when properly primed, could attack the dangerous Alzheimer's proteins in the brain.]]></text>

Now, a new report suggests why that may be the case. Writing in the March 31 issue of Neuroscience, researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles said it appeared that ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including naproxen, might dissolve the brain lesions that occur in Alzheimer's. The lesions are caused by a plaque buildup. The drugs bind to the plaque, possibly preventing new lesions and dissolving existing ones, wrote the lead author, Dr. Jorge R. Barrio, and his colleagues. Scientists have been making progress on the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's, discovering it before the disease begins destroying brain function. But they have not found a way to stop the process.]]></text>

			<description>Scientists discovered that indoor air pollution is more injurious to public health than outdoor pollution and steps have been taken to address the problem.</description>
			<narrative>Relevant documents note that the American Lung Association said that indoor air pollution can be 2-100 times more toxic than outdoor air. Indoor pollutants contribute to lung cancer, asthma, chronic rhinitis, nausea, nasal congestion, sinusitis and fatigue. Among common indoor pollutants are second-hand tobacco smoke, hair sprays, cleaning products , toxic materials in wallboards, furniture and carpets and deadly carbon monoxide and radon. Solutions to the problem included everything from indoor plants to air cleaners and better ventilation.</narrative>

First, there was the problem with asbestos, then lead and radon. Now, state officials are seeing a growing number of complaints and inquiries about indoor air pollution, often tied to old or complex heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems, poorly constructed or sealed buildings, leaking roofs, inadequately trained maintenance staffs and a lack of state or local regulations regarding environmental inspections. Parents, in addition to school staffs, should be more alert to conditions, experts say, and report dust, dampness or mold problems they may see to health authorities.]]></text>

The studies are being conducted in experimental chambers at NASA's Stennis Space Center at Bay St. Louis, Miss. Scientists say polluted rooms cannot be cleaned up by plants alone. No amount of greenery, for example, is likely to reduce the smoke and dust in a room. Even when plants do filter specific chemicals, they are much more effective in the sealed conditions of a space station than in a house or an apartment, where the effects of ventilation usually far outweigh those of plants. Still, the new studies indicate that well-chosen greenery can reduce the levels of some dangerous contaminants.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Reducing indoor air pollutants is a greater challenge, and there is a greater variety of devices to choose from, ranging from less than $50 to around $800. An air cleaner will not effectively remove radon, experts say. And the usefulness of air cleaners in removing such gases as formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide varies widely, according to a 1986 study by a Rodale Press magazine, New Shelter (since renamed Practical Homeowner). But the cleaners can draw airborne pollutant particles from the air. The basic components of air cleaners are a fan to draw in air and filtering devices that trap particles. Some units combine air cleaners with negative-ion generators. Extravagant medical claims have been associated with negative-ion generators. The charged ions the generators emit do, however, have a demonstrable benefit; they act like magnets on pollution particles. This makes such devices especially good at removing smoke from the air. Experts recommend units with fans. The experts' choice are devices that combine technologies for maximum efficacy. The Bionaire 1000, for example, combines an ion generator with an electrically charged filter. Others - like the King-Aire Freedom, the King-Aire Eliminator, the E. L. Foust Series 400 and the Cleanaire 150 by Air Techniques - combine carbon filters and top-of-the line filters made with glass fibers. An Electrical Trap Some experts prefer air cleaners that incorporates electrostatic precipitators, which charge incoming particles and trap them on plates with an opposite charge. An example is the Honeywell F59A. Even though some experts have found that air cleaners help asthmatics and others with allergies, manufacturers are not permitted to make health claims, according to Food and Drug Administration officials, because these devices have not been approved for such purposes. To be effective, air cleaners and ionizers must be of a size and a capacity that is proportionate to the space where they will be used. Air cleaners that are built into homes are the most effective.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Good ventilation can help alleviate the problem of indoor smoke, but many people who work in close quarters with smokers may wonder whether desk-top air cleaners work. The answer is ''partly,'' according to researchers who have tested air-cleaning systems at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California and at the John B. Pierce Foundation Laboratory, affiliated with Yale University. There are more than 3,800 types of particles and gases in cigarette smoke. Both labs found that electrostatic precipitators, which give the particles an electrical charge and then use that charge to attract them to an oppositely charged collection plate, were effective in removing some of the particles, but not the various gases in smoke. Air cleaners that draw cigarette smoke through a charcoal filter were more effective in trapping some of the gases. Consumer Reports, in 1985, and New Shelter magazine, in 1982, both tested portable air cleaners, and both gave the the Bionaire 1000 the top rating. The Bionaire is one of many ''ionizer'' air cleaners on the market. The ionizer models also charge particles, and, their makers say, the charge causes the particles to settle out of the atmosphere more quickly.]]></text>

Outside, radon dissipates quickly and is not regarded as a serious health risk. The hazard, however, arises indoors. In the last two years, scientists became aware that levels in homes can be far higher than ever imagined. The Federal Enviromental Protection Agency said in August that perhaps 8 million of the nation's 70 million homes had radon levels above its recommended guideline. Radon experts in the scientific community are more conservative, saying that the number may be closer to five million.]]></text>

Both Democratic and Republican members of the Senate panel quickly criticized Mr. Potter's testimony as another attempt by the Reagan Administration to obstruct environmental legislation.

The current operating budget is almost 20 percent lower in real dollars than the 1981 budget, and President Reagan's proposed fiscal 1988 budget would actually cut E.P.A.'s current operating funds.

In this category are indoor air pollution, global warming as a result of fossil fuel combustion, and destruction of the earth's protective ozone layer by man-made chemicals.

					<text><![CDATA[The problems of indoor air quality arose after the energy crisis of the 1970's and the drive for energy-efficient buildings. ''We then saw the construction of buildings that are basically jars,'' Mr. Sahn said. ''Tightly sealed buildings with windows that didn't open were expected to conserve energy. They put more pressure on the ventilation system to be the generator of the building and if that wasn't maintained properly, impure air traveled throughout a building, making it sick.'' Concerns about indoor air pollution, which has resulted in what is called ''sick building syndrome,'' have prompted Long Island architects to promote the awareness of new technology for clean indoor air and New York State to adopt a tax incentive to encourage the design of energy-efficient and environmentally safe -- or so-called green -- buildings. The ''green building credit'' against state income taxes was signed into law two years ago, but its implementation has been held up in ''a debate of final issues'' by the Department of Environmental Conservation, said Craig Kneeland, senior project manager for the state's Energy Research and Development Authority.]]></text>

The conditions can vary depending on body chemistry and the amount of exposure to chemicals, contaminated air or pesticides. What also happens, experts say, is that once victims have been afflicted -- even if their health improves -- exposure to certain chemicals or products can prompt a relapse even if the patients were not previously sensitive to them. Many cases are linked to ''sick building syndrome,'' which most commonly occurs in poorly ventilated buildings where formaldehyde gas is trapped after being released from new carpeting, glues or furniture. S.B.S. can also be caused by mold and mildew in air-conditioning. ''Nationwide, indoor air pollution costs tens of billions of dollars annually,'' wrote Nicholas Ashord and Claudia Miller in their book, ''Chemical Exposure'' (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1997).

					<text><![CDATA[Agency officials said they thought one major reason for the unexpectedly high radon levels in classrooms was that ventilation systems work poorly in many schools, tending to build up concentrations of the radon by exhausting more air than they bring in. As a result, air tends to enter from the foundations of the building, bringing radon from the ground with it. Radon is a colorless, odorless gas that occurs naturally as a result of the decay of uranium in the soil and rocks. The gas produces radioactive particles that can lodge in the lung and cause lung cancer. Outdoors, radon dissipates and is relatively harmless. But inside some buildings, particularly airtight, poorly ventilated buildings, it can accumulate to concentrations that, over years of exposure, can raise the risk of lung cancer. Smoking adds substantially to the risk, the Public Health Service has warned.]]></text>

The report persuasively argues that inhaling secondhand smoke can cause both immediate and long-term harm to the millions of Americans, young and old, who are still regularly exposed to it despite crackdowns in many states and localities. Although the strength of the evidence varies from one ailment to another, the report cites many alarming findings. The smoke inhaled by adult nonsmokers increases their risk of heart disease by 25 to 30 percent and lung cancer by 20 to 30 percent. Such smoke is even more dangerous to children and infants because it is a known cause of sudden infant death syndrome, respiratory problems, ear infections and asthma.]]></text>

The officials said American intelligence agencies had for years worked on the assumption that the North probably possessed nuclear weapons. Just last week, two White House officials traveled to Asia with assessments that North Korea's arsenal had probably enlarged and with evidence that the country had probably sold partly processed nuclear fuel on the black market. In Washington, intelligence officials were scanning satellite imagery for any evidence that North Korea might be preparing a nuclear test, but so far have seen none, officials said.]]></text>

It is unlikely that the United Nations will take meaningful action in this situation, since no power other than the United States possesses the means to back up words with action. Even if the administration's strategy of isolating North Korea works, at best it would amount to a partial tightening of sanctions against a country whose economy is already moribund. The only additional threat available is the denial of food aid for the people of North Korea, an act that would take the United States into new moral territory.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[OF all the crises facing the new United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the fraying nuclear nonproliferation system is arguably the most consequential. Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has warned of 30 ''virtual new weapons states'' on the horizon. Obviously, the more countries that possess the bomb, the higher the risk of a nuclear accident, the theft of a weapon, sales of technology and hardware, and a serious miscalculation leading to nuclear war. So where should Mr. Ban start? With North Korea having declared after its test last October that it now possesses a nuclear deterrent, the understandable temptation will be to focus on Iran. This would be a mistake. North Korea is still some way off from having a reliable nuclear weapon, and to accept its having this capacity as a fait accompli would not only play into its game plan but also convince Iran and other countries that the international community lacks the will to prevent them from developing the bomb. A new approach is required. The logical place to look is to examine the lessons of ''nuclear reversal'' -- that is, what has made states in the past give up the nuclear option.]]></text>

The announcement may ease the tension that has built up in recent months.

The resolution, drafted by the United States, clears the way for the toughest international action against North Korea since the end of the Korean War. Primarily, it bars the sale or transfer of material that could be used to make nuclear, biological and chemical weapons or ballistic missiles, and it bans international travel and freezes the overseas assets of people associated with the North's weapons programs.]]></text>

Bush administration officials said they feared that North Korea could use that plutonium to manufacture five or six nuclear weapons within months. The action, coming one day after North Korea took similar monitoring equipment off a nuclear reactor, intensifies the crisis over North Korea's nuclear capability, at a moment when President Bush has tried to focus the world's attention on the threat posed by Iraq.

This follows its decision on Tuesday to put its army on alert in reaction to the Team Spirit exercises conducted by U.S. and South Korean forces. Pyongyang is understandably provoked by the resumption of the exercises after a year's hiatus, but withdrawing from the nonproliferation treaty is an exceedingly unwise act that will arouse the worse suspicions about Pyongyang's nuclear intentions.]]></text>

			<description>After years of twists and turns the abortion pill RU-486 was approved for distribitution to women in the United states under the name of mifespristone.</description>
			<narrative>Relevant documents capture news stories covering the history of the abortion drug RU-486, known as mifepristone in the United States, from its development in France to approval  by the Food and Drug Administration for termination of early pregnancy. Despite considerable congressional opposition and efforts by anti-abortion groups, the drug was approved and has been used  by large numbers of women, although several have died from associated bacterial infections. The drug interferes with uterine implantation of fertilized eggs, causing an abortion.</narrative>

But the organization said it would make no general announcement of the sites where women could obtain the drug because of concerns about potential violence. A French company, Roussel Uclaf, which makes and distributes the abortion pill in Europe, has turned over to the council the United States rights to the drug mifepristone, the chemical name for RU-486. In a telephone press conference from New York, council officials said that they knew of no threats against the council or against the 12 to 20 clinics that will be giving the drug on an experimental basis but that they were still concerned about possible violence. Each clinic will decide whether to announce its own participation in the trials, which began within the last month.]]></text>

Under heavy pressure from the Clinton Administration, Roussel Uclaf, the company that developed the pill, RU-486, had agreed to an unusual arrangement in which it would donate the American patent rights to the Population Council, a nonprofit contraceptive research group based in New York. The Population Council predicted confidently that the drug, known generically as mifepristone, would be available to American women in 1996.]]></text>

It is not used as a morning-after contraceptive pill but instead is taken to end an actual pregnancy up to seven weeks after the last menstrual period. Mifepristone would not completely replace surgical abortions in the United States, in part because it must be used so early in pregnancy. But it would make abortions more easily available, because it could be provided by doctors who are not trained to do surgical abortions, as long as they are near medical facilities where a surgical abortion could be performed if efforts at the drug-induced one failed.]]></text>

Lawrence Lader, the president of Abortion Rights Mobilization, plans to announce today that his group will offer the drug, mifepristone, to as many as 10,000 women seeking to end their pregnancies without a surgical abortion.

			<description>Find information on how and where cashews are grown, any problems that are involved, and any industrial use for the cashew plant.</description>
			<narrative>I want to identify geographical areas where cashews are grown. If cashews are identified as ingredients in the cooking of a certain country or region, that indicates that cashews are grown there. The botanical aspect of the plants' growth is also of interest, also whether cashew farming is done by individual farmers or big commercial operations.Political situations, economic measures or anything else that interferes with  successful cashew farming is relevant. Industrial uses for cashew products are also of interest.</narrative>

Moreover, according to outside scholars, 60 percent of the new villages were on semiarid land unsuitable for long-term cultivation. Attempts were made to dictate the growing of certain crops, notably fire-cured tobacco, to be sold at what villagers saw as confiscatory prices set by government agencies. Peasants resisted this, and they also ignored annual work plans and production targets. With people having left their old cashew trees behind, a huge share of that once-important crop went ungathered.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[I've been told the cashew tree produces an apple that is technically not a fruit, and a nut that is technically not a nut. Botanically speaking, what is a fruit, what is a nut, and where does the bounty of the cashew tree fall? A. Botanically speaking, a fruit is the matured ovary of a seed-producing plant, including the seeds, their coating and anything immediately associated with them. A nut is harder to crack. Technically, a nut is a hard, one-celled, one-seeded fruit whose seed is enclosed in a woody or leathery coating, and it does not open when ripe. But some nuts, including walnuts, are ambiguous. Because their fleshy coatings split, they fall somewhere between true nuts and the kernels of stone fruits, like almonds, which (technically) are not nuts at all. But these are models of clarity compared with the cashew, Anacardium occidentale. In the cashew's case, the large, juicy, fleshy item, called an apple in spite of its decidedly pear shape, is technically a swollen peduncle, or stalk. At the end of the stalk, while it is still small and svelte, a flower grows. From the flower comes the cashew nut, which is technically the fruit of the tree. Once the fruit is formed, both it and the stalk start to swell, and by harvest time, the stalk is 8 to 10 times bigger than the fruit. There's not much to this so-called fruit except the sweet, meaty kernel we know as a cashew, but it does include a thin, hard shell and a clinging film of brown skin. These are both removed before the nut is marketed, and a good thing, too. The cashew is related to poison ivy, and the oils in its shell cause allergic reactions far worse than those inflicted by that odious vine.]]></text>

The place has a polish that reflects experience. Pleasant, muted colors recall the yellow-browns of coriander, before and after roasting and grinding. Walls, half-walls and a raised platform create separate and intimate spaces. The waterfall opposite the door supplies a soothing backdrop of sound. The food, under the direction of C. P. Bhandari, the chef, uses familiar ingredients -- yogurt, lamb, chicken, rice, lentils, peanuts -- combined in ways that might be novel to an American palate. The crab salad (nandu puttu), though highly spiced, was considerably more interesting than the ubiquitous crab cake. It juxtaposed the yielding flesh with the crunch of cashew]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Sapphire, a newcomer in the Lincoln Center neighborhood, may not be the last word in Indian cuisine, but it is good enough and good-looking enough to advance the cause. The extensive menu includes the usual hit parade of samosas, curries, tandoori treats and even mulligatawny soup. But it also includes some sleepers like chutney idli, a small cake of steamed lentil and rice flour topped with a coconut curry. Spicier and just as good is kadhi pakoda, another appetizer. Balls of cumin-spiced lentil flour are deep-fried and served with a mustard-flavor yogurt sauce. I found the lamb to be tough in the several dishes I tried, like achari lamb and lamb xacutti (pronounced ESH-uh-coo-tee). Chicken, on the other hand, was unfailingly moist, tender and flavorful, especially the chicken Nizami, a masala dish with cashews]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Bombay Brasserie Cook Book'' by Chef Udit Sarkhel (Pavilion Books Limited). The following recipes will make a complete Indian meal for eight people. Beer is the best drink to have with them. Pan Fried Chicken With Green Herbs Total time: 3 hours 13-to-3 1/2-pound chicken, quartered with the skin left on Juice of 1 1/2 limes Coarse salt to taste 6green chilies, seeded and chopped 6garlic cloves, peeled and coarsely chopped 1tablespoon cardamom seeds 1/2teaspoon cloves 1cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped 1tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled 2tablespoons white vinegar 1teaspoon sugar 1/2teaspoon cumin seeds 1/2teaspoon tumeric 2potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/2-inch thick Coriander leaves to garnish. 1. Pierce the chicken pieces all over with a fork. Put them in a dish and squeeze a lime over them and season them with salt. Set aside. Put all the ingredients except the potatoes and the coriander leaves for the marsala in a blender or food processor and process until a fine paste forms. Spread this marsala all over the chicken pieces and set aside to marinate for at least two hours at room temperature. 2. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the chicken pieces and fry them for 10 to 12 minutes, turning until the skin is dark brown and crispy and the juices run clear when each piece is pricked with the tip of a knife. Turn over the pieces several times while they are frying. 3. Halfway through the cooking process, arrange the potatoes in a ring around the chicken so they fry with the chicken. If there is not enough room, they can be fried in the fat remaining in the pan after the chicken is removed and kept warm. Serve with the potatoes arranged around the chicken and garnish with coriander leaves. Yield: 4 servings. Mashed Eggplant With Spices Total time: 1 hour 4large eggplants, about 2 pounds total weight 1to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil plus a little extra for grilling 2tablespoons unsalted butter 4green chilies, seeded and finely chopped 2onions finely chopped 2cloves garlic finely chopped 1inch-long piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped 1tablespoon tumeric 2teaspoons chili powder 5tomatoes peeled, seeded and chopped 1tablespoon goan marsala (available in specialty stores) Coarse salt to taste 2tablespoons chopped fresh coriander to garnish. 1. Baste the eggplants with a small amount of oil and char grill or broil them until their skins are almost crisp. If possible, do this over coals on a barbecue, or boil the eggplant for 20 minutes and then drain well. When the eggplants are cool enough to handle, peel off the skins and mash the flesh. 2. Melt the butter with the remaining oil in a large flame-proof casserole or wok. Add the chilies, onions, garlic and ginger and stir-fry until the onions are translucent. Add the tumeric and chili powder and continue stir-frying for three minutes. 3. Stir in the tomatoes and continue cooking for another two minutes. Stir in the mashed eggplant pulp and stir-fry for six minutes. Add the goan marsala and salt. Serve garnished with coriander. Yield: 4 servings. Lamb Curry Flavored With Black Cardamom Total time: 1 1/2 hours 15 cashew nuts]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Origin Thai Inc. is a 55-seat restaurant occupying a old storefront that blends in to the mostly deserted evening streetscape -- except for the steady stream of diners headed in looking hungry and leaving looking happy. Good signs, since on my first visit I am courting trouble by taking Thai-foodie friends to a place I hadn't scouted. Inside, it's loud, with sounds bouncing way up to the old tin ceiling, past the pair of 1904 Coast Guard oars and back down, blending conversations with the clatter of clearing dishes and clinking glasses and making a chat with the host an intimate affair. We settle in with menus, lifting our eyes long enough to note -- and covet -- platters going to other diners. We order. We wait. We speculate. I hope that the food is as good as it looks, that there is substance to these elegant, artistic plates. Finally, some of those beautiful platters begin arriving at our table. With every bite, my hopes rise, because the appetizers and the salads are excellent. Fragrant little curls of steam rise from a pyramid of grilled squid, the white flesh only slightly overcooked and still a tasty complement to the cool mix of baby greens, diced mangoes, tomatoes and shallots spiked with basil, mint, fish sauce, chili peppers, lemon juice and tamarind. The caramelized quail is succulent and sweet, its tenderness a match for the sweet snow peas in an orange vinaigrette. Mr. Sutipayakul treats the soft-shell crab with respect, frying it fast and serving it hot between layers of cooling ginger, green mango and cashews.]]></text>

An order of lad nha seafood featured a bed of large, flat noodles topped by broccoli julienne, shrimp and squid. The dark horse of the noodle dishes, though, was pad khi mao, based on flat, transparent mung bean noodles, just a tad spicy, with vegetables and basil. For this, we chose beef, but the friend who recommended the dish swears by shrimp. Your call. Among the many savory entrées, the hands-down winner was kang panang. Shrimp made a pleasing choice for this yellow panang curry and exquisitely complex, mildly spicy-sweet sauce. Rich, heavy coconut milk acted as the vehicle for a perfectly balanced seasoning that included coriander, lemon grass, chili and lime. Chicken with cashews (pahd cashew nut)]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Hong Kong-style Cantonese restaurants. Congee is not much to look at. With a plastic grape arbor hanging near the kitchen, more grapes painted on imitation stained-glass windows, and a small plastic panel of a blue sky, its oddball interior lacks Congee Village's stylish evocation of life in a hamlet. But the food is fresh and vivid, with clear spicing and pure flavors. Of course, I'm disposed toward congee ($2 to $7.75), but even so, Congee's is outstanding. It arrives bubbling in a crock, smelling of ginger and lemon. I especially liked it with slivers of savory pork and bits of pungent preserved egg, or with black mushrooms and velvety slices of chicken breast, and I liked a shot of hot sauce in it as well. If your soul does not cry out for congee, the restaurant offers many other superb dishes, with none better than deep-fried golden-skinned chicken, chopped into manageable pieces and topped with plenty of chopped garlic and scallions ($9 half, $18 whole). Under the crisp exterior the flesh is juicy and rich, exhibit No. 1 in the case against boring chicken dishes. Squab with soy sauce ($13.95) presents a different side of poultry, but makes a similar point. The small bird, lacquered and shiny, has an almost liver-like flavor that is a welcome antidote to the more typically bland squabs and quails. I loved salt-baked squid with cashews]]></text>

Pongal is a nice place to eat with a group of four or more, so that you can sample an assortment of dishes. Appetizers ought to include iddly, steamed cakes of lentils and rice that arrive in rasam ($4.95), a spicy lentil broth, or in sambar ($3.95), a chunky soup that is a little less spicy than the rasam. Both go well with dosai podi ($1.25), a peppery sauce also known as red gunpowder. Vada, crisp, spicy doughnuts made with lentil flour, make a nice counterpoint to the iddly. They also come with rasam ($4.95) and sambar ($3.95). Dahi vada ($4.95), lentil balls in a spicy yogurt sauce, is a mouthful of contrasts. The yogurt is cooling and refreshing, yet the peppery edge sets the mouth aglow. It goes beautifully with the accompanying coconut chutney. Spinach pakoda ($3.95), fritters of spinach and chickpea flour, are savory, while masala cashew nuts]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Northern India with unique skill, balancing the myriad flavors so well that each taste plays and teases briefly on the tongue before merging into a delicious whole. The restaurant's décor is hardly impressive. There is a cold hollowness in its unadorned walls and a ceiling so high that one can easily overlook two crystal chandeliers, an odd match for bare pine tables better suited to a cozy log cabin. But what the restaurant lacks in ambience it makes up for with some mighty gorgeous food. In the cooking style of the region, tandoori or clay oven roasting is frequently used -- providing a delicious alternative to the saucy curries, which were rich and lovely and veered toward the aromatic rather than the spicy hot. Vegetable dishes and breads were also notable. A flaky samosa filled with mildly seasoned potato and pea filling made a sturdy starter, as did a mix of boneless chicken, mint and cilantro. It's a good idea to order breads along with appetizers. (Rice comes with the entrees.) Although they can be ordered individually, we opted for the basket, which holds an excellent assortment of onion kulcha and fluffy, buttery paratha and is covered by a long, supple ''tongue'' of nan. The menu offers cutlery on request, although it's already on the table. Traditionally, pieces of pliant bread are used to scoop curries, and fingers serve for large pieces of meat. An appetizer portion of tandoori shrimp arrived with four juicy jumbos, marinated and spicy hot. Two thin rolls of minced vegetable kebabs were mild yet flavorful. But the pickled, roasted mushrooms could be an acquired taste, and potatoes stuffed with raisins and cashews]]></text>

The center of the chop is ideally tender, moist and pink while the marinade outside is cooked into a silky cloak that's one with the meat itself. The scant flesh running the length of the rib is transformed into charred lamb candy, the bones begging to be gnawed clean. The lamb, like all the tandoori dishes and curries, is accompanied by fragrant, fluffy and perfectly cooked basmati rice. Mr. Xalxo says he prepares the rice from a recipe that includes doses of cumin, ginger and garlic. The best dinner one could have at Earthen Oven would include the lamb chops and the accompanying rice; one of the tandoori flatbreads (the rosemary nan is the least exciting of the bunch; the onion kulcha, with its appealing juxtaposition of sweet cooked onions and black tandoori char, is the best); the supremely rich black lentil dal named after Mr. Prasad ($11.95); and a curry from Mr. Xalxo's side of the kitchen.

Try goenchi dal ani batata bhaji, which mates lentils with potatoes or the assortment called ''boss's vegetables.'' Incidentally, sharing an entree can carry a charge of $5, sometimes waived when a meal begins with an appetizer course. Ask. An acquired taste, saanas (like idli), a steamed rice bread, took its texture from the addition of shredded coconut; the baked flat wheat bread called chappatti was nicely buttery and soft. But rice is the carbohydrate of the south, making breads unnecessary. Condiments serve to refresh the palate, and quite a few pickles and relishes are available. We enjoyed tindli pickle and mango chutney, always a winner. After a meal of such assertive flavors, sweet things contrasted nicely, and some of the desserts here were dandy, like ice creams (mango, fabulous cinnamon, rare cashew]]></text>

When news of San Miguel's successes spread, the owner of a Filipino stuffed-toy firm, BMR Industries, offered to hire the women as subcontractors. Within three months, 300 people were producing stuffed toys. Not long afterward, BMR's main factory and warehouse were flooded, and the company suspended operations. Undaunted, the women of San Miguel exported the toys themselves. With a $100,000 loan from the state Technology and Livelihood Resource Center, they bought materials from Taiwan and sold the finished product to Dan-Dee, which distributes to American stores like K Mart and J. C.Penney. ''The women of San Miguel are ready to produce 100,000 dozen toys a month, but don't have enough capital,'' Sylvia Munoz-Ordonez, the director of the Filipino women's foundation, recently told a representative from the United Nations development fund for women. She said she hoped the fund would help finance a new project converting the household sewing centers into centrally managed production centers, which would provide 1,000 workers with an average yearly income of $1,870. The women's latest undertaking is what they call the greening of San Miguel. Reinvesting half of their nearly $48,000 savings from stuffed toys, they purchased 112 acres to plant trees yielding mangoes, soursops, and cashews.]]></text>

''I know the disease was caused by spirits because after we held a big ceremony with all the villagers, people stopped dying and didn't get sick any more,'' the village chief said. The random attacks of the disease have made it hard to pinpoint just which spirits are angry, he said. One shaman told the people of Ping that they were being punished for felling sacred trees. Another told the family of a 16-year-old girl named Mel -- one of the first to die -- that she was being punished for having a sexual affair. Her older sister, Nieng, said the shaman had told the truth about Mel, who sometimes disappeared into the woods to collect cashew nuts.]]></text>

In 1995 the processing plants were privatized, bought mainly by foreigners, and the state monopoly was eliminated. But it was replaced by a stiff export tax levied on raw, but not processed, nuts. This in effect prevented the farmers from selling their product on the world market, and forced them to continue selling cheaply to domestic processers.]]></text>

					<text><![CDATA[Shining Path has faced surprisingly little resistance. Most of the 15,000 or so people killed by both sides in the nine-year-old war have been noncombatants. In some areas, army brutality has alienated the local population. In other areas, the soldiers, underpaid, badly equipped and demoralized, have barely put up a fight. In mid-March, the Government announced an all-out war against subversion, but two weeks later, rebels killed 13 people at a police post in the (Continued on Page 100) Upper Huallaga Valley. The pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru movement, in contrast, has fared poorly; its leader, Victor Polay, was arrested in February and troops killed 62 of its combatants in a battle April 28.]]></text>

Using familiar leftist language and led by middle-class urban intellectuals, it has been more easily infiltrated and has suffered major setbacks at the hands of the police. The complexity of the Shining Path, on the other hand, stems from the fact that it fits into no simple category. It apparently has no links with foreign revolutionary movements, it uses outright terror as a political weapon, it breeds fanatical loyalty among its followers and it values secrecy over publicity.]]></text>
