	<topic name="Return of Klimt paintings to Maria Altmann" id="dd17-1">
	  <description>Find information about the artwork by Austrian painter Gustav Klimt that was stolen by Nazis from its Austrian owners and subsequently returned to the rightful heir, Maria Altmann.</description>
	  <narrative>This topic follows developments in the case of six specific paintings stolen by the Nazis during WWII.  The stolen paintings were given to a relative of the artist (Gustav Klimt), who in turn gave them to the Austrian government. Maria Altmann, heir of the original owners and in her 90s and living in California, was able to reclaim the art after a lengthy battle in U.S. and Austrian courts.   Information about Ms. Altmann’s legal pursuit, which went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court; the resistance by the Austrian Government to turning over the paintings; and the final agreement by both sides to an arbitrated settlement is all relevant.  I was further interested in the reasons for the subsequent sale of the paintings by Ms. Altmann. Only the six paintings that comprised the Altmann case are relevant; work by other artists and other work by Klimt that had been confiscated by the Nazis is not relevant.</narrative>

	<topic name="Who Outed Valerie Plame?" id="dd17-2">
	  <description>Who outed covert CIA operative Valerie Plame?</description>
	  <narrative>This topic asks who identified undercover CIA operative Valerie Plame to newspaper columnist Robert Novak, who published her name and Agency association in his column.  All references to possible sources of the information given to Mr. Novak is relevant, including both journalists and officials within the Bush administration.  Ultimately, Novak’s sources were identified as Richard Armitage, a State Dept. deputy and White House official Karl Rove.   The indictment of Scooter Libby, VP Cheney’s chief of staff is relevant.  Libby was ultimately convicted of perjury in his testimony to a grand jury and to FBI investigators regarding how he learned Ms. Plame’s identity and to whom he divulged it.  The entire scenario played out over 2-plus years while a special prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, pursued the source(s) of the leak.   Information about the underlying reasons for the leak, allegedly to justify a flawed rationale for the Iraq invasion; and legal battles over freedom of the press and subpoenas for journalists’ testimony and notes, are not relevant.</narrative>

	<topic name="Dwarf Planets" id="dd17-6">
	  <description>What is a dwarf planet and which celestial bodies are considered dwarf planets?</description>
	  <narrative>I wanted to learn the definitions of planets and dwarf planets, and I wanted to learn which celestial bodies became classified as dwarf planets.  The specific definitions were relevant and I judged them based on their specificity.  Any discussion of Pluto being "downgraded" to a dwarf planet also was relevant as was information on Eris/Xena and Ceres being reclassified as dwarf planets.  Specific information on the International Astronomical Union"s definition was key; debate leading up to the issuance of the definition was highly relevant.  Data on a museum and planetarium"s demotion of Pluto prior to the release of the officially recognized definition of dwarf planets was judged highly relevant.  Information on brown, red, and white dwarfs was not relevant.  General information on the discovery of the Kuiper Belt and "planet-like" bodies found there was not relevant.  A gray area was an asteroid named Eros; I never saw any information that indicated that "Eros" was an alternate spelling for "Eris," one of the dwarf planets, and so references to "Eros" were not relevant.</narrative>

	<topic name="Warsaw Pact Dissolves" id="dd17-7">
	  <description>What caused the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact?</description>
	  <narrative>This topic examines the multi-faceted reasons for the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact.  One sub-topic addressed the varying perspectives of the East European members, including impetuses for national autonomy, economic revival, and political freedom.  The second sub-topic considered the Soviet reaction to those developments.   While Mikhail Gorbachev had encouraged the European Pact members to loosen economic and political constraints within their countries, he did not foresee or want the dissolution of the military alliance.  Overtaken by rapid evolution of events, including the fall of the Berlin wall, the reunification of Germany, and the prospect of Pact members becoming part of NATO, the Soviet Union acceded to the inevitable.  Warsaw Pact member states formally ended their multi-national alliance on March 31, 1991. Developments in Eastern Europe beyond those affecting the status of the Warsaw Pact, simultaneous negotiations between NATO and the Pact for conventional arms reduction, Gorbachev’s reform movement within the USSR, or reactions to any of these developments by the U.S. or Western Europe were not relevant.</narrative>
