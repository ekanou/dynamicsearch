<p> Search engine are often used to complete complex information tasks. These tasks cannot be expressed with a single query, may be composed by multiple sub-tasks that need to be completed, the information need of the user may change throughout a task completion effort, learning effects take place, while users may not know exactly what they are looking for or how to formulate their information need. </p>

Information Retrieval research has traditionally focused on serving the best results for a single query— so­called ad hoc retrieval. However, users typically search iteratively, refining and reformulating their queries during a session. A key challenge in the study of this interaction is the creation of suitable evaluation resources to assess the effectiveness of IR systems over sessions.

<a id="trec-session" class="anchor" href="#trec-session" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TREC Session Track.</h3>
The <a href="http://ir.cis.udel.edu/sessions/">TREC Session Track</a>, which ran from 2010 through to 2014, had always had two primary goals: (1) to test whether systems can improve their performance for a given query by using previous user interactions with a retrieval system (including previous queries, clicks on ranked results, dwell times, etc.), and (2) to evaluate system performance over an entire query session instead of a single query. However, it only produced test collections to evaluate the first goal, given that the second one required a dynamic test collection, where users react upon the results returned by a retrieval system.

<a id="trec-tasks" class="anchor" href="#trec-tasks" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TREC Tasks Track.</h3>
In 2015 the <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/tasks-track-2015/">TREC Tasks</a> track was introduced to test whether systems upon a user’s query could understand the underlying information access task and provide documents for all possible subtasks as a way to evaluate the second goal of the Session track. However, this stripped out the task from any user interactions and the dynamics of any such collection.

<a id="clef-lab" class="anchor" href="#clef-lab" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CLEF 2017 Lab Workshop on Dynamic Search for Complex Tasks</h3>
The workshop will attempt to bridge the TREC Session and Task evaluation exercises, with the goal of evaluating system performance over an entire session, keeping the “user” in the loop. 

<h3>
<a id="lab-goals" class="anchor" href="#lab-goals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lab Objectives</h3>
The objective of the lab is threefold: 
<ol>
  <li>to produce the methodology and algorithms that will lead to a dynamic test collection by simulating the users</li>
  <li>to understand and quantify in terms of evaluation measures what constitutes a good ranking of documents at different stages of a session, and a good overall session</li>
  <li>to lead to algorithms that can provide an optimal ranking throughout a session.</li>
</ol>

  <h3>Proposed Tasks</h3>
  <ol>
    <dt>Task 1:</dt>
    <dd>
      Construction of dynamic collections (simulations). The first task will evaluate simulations of user interactions. Simulations can be evaluated against static user logs, or actual users. This is a topic of discussion during the proposed workshop.
    </dd>
    <dt>Task 2:</dt>
    <dd>Session search evaluation. The second task will evaluate proposed metrics both for overall session evaluation, and for step­by­step session evaluation. Metrics should be applied on a reusable test collection, however they can be (meta­) evaluated against an interactive experiment with actual users.
    </dd>
    <dt> Task 3:</dt>
    <dd>Session search. The third task will evaluate retrieval effectiveness on the results of the two previous tasks. This third task can run in a follow­up year of the lab, after Task 1 and Task 2 have established the details of the evaluation framework.
    </dd>
