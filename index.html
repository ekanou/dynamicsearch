<p>Search algorithms have been optimized to serve the best results for a single query, ignoring the reasons (or the task) that might have motivated the user to submit that query. Often times search engines are used to complete complex tasks (information needs); achieving these tasks with current search engines requires users to issue multiple queries. For example, booking travel to a location such as London could require the user to submit various queries such as flights to London, hotels in London, points of interest around London, etc. Similarly, a person who is trying to organize a wedding would need to issue separate queries in order to locate stores to buy a wedding gown, arrange catering, book honeymoon, etc. In some cases users may not even be aware of all the subtasks they need to achieve to satisfy their information need, which makes search an even more difficult experience. </p>
