                    <p>The <strong>objective</strong> of the lab is threefold:<\p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>to produce the methodology and algorithms that will lead to a <em>dynamic test collection</em> by simulating the users</li>
                        <li>to understand and quantify in terms of evaluation measures what constitutes a good ranking of documents at <em>different stages of a session</em>, and a good overall session</li>
                        <li>to lead to algorithms that can provide an optimal ranking throughout a session.</li>

                    <h3>Proposed Tasks</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <dt>Task 1:</dt>
                            <dd>
                            Construction of dynamic collections (simulations). The first task will evaluate simulations of user interactions. Simulations can be evaluated against static user logs, or actual users. This is a topic of discussion during the proposed workshop.
                            </dd>
                            <dt>Task 2:</dt>
                            <dd>Session search evaluation. The second task will evaluate proposed metrics both for overall session evaluation, and for step­by­step session evaluation. Metrics should be applied on a reusable test collection, however they can be (meta­) evaluated against an interactive experiment with actual users.
                            </dd>
                            <dt> Task 3:</dt>
                            <dd>Session search. The third task will evaluate retrieval effectiveness on the results of the two previous tasks. This third task can run in a follow­up year of the lab, after Task 1 and Task 2 have established the details of the evaluation framework.
