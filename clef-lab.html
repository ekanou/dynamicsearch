      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Information Retrieval (IR) research has traditionally focused on serving the best results for a single query — so-called ad hoc retrieval. However, users typically search iteratively, refining and reformulating their queries during a session. A key challenge in the study of this interaction is the creation of suitable evaluation resources to assess the effectiveness of retrieval systems over sessions. The TREC Interactive, Session and Tasks tracks attempted to approach this problem, without managing to produce a reusable test collection to evaluate the entire sessions of a conversation between a user and a machine. The problem remains open.</p>
			<p>It has become urgent for the community, and especially forums such as TREC, CLEF, NTCIR to put a focus on and provide such a setup that will put IR at the frontline in developing dynamic systems that better fit the IR needs. The Dynamic Search Lab attempts to construct such reusable test collections and metrics that will allow the development of dynamic search algorithms. The objective of the lab is threefold: 
	 			<ul>
	   			<li>to produce the methodology and algorithms that will lead to a dynamic test collection by simulating the users,</li>
	   			<li>to understand and quantify in terms of evaluation measures what constitutes a good ranking of documents at different stages of a session, and a good overall session</li>
	   			<li>to develop algorithms that can provide an optimal ranking throughout a session.</li>
	 			</ul>

		<h3>Lab Overview</h3>
		<p>We view the problem of dynamic search as the development of two agents, a <i>question agent</i> and an <i>answer agent</i>. The two agents interact with each other towards fulfilling a user's information need.
		<ul>
			<li> <strong>A-agent:</strong> The TREC Session and Dynamic Domain tracks considered the development of advanced answer agents, retrieval systems that account both for session contextual information and the dynamic interaction with the Q-Agent when ranking documents. The 2018 DynSe Lab will consider as an answer agent a traditional ad-hoc retrieval system.</li>
			<li> <strong>Q-agent:</strong> The 2018 DynSe Lab will consider the development of effective question agents. These agents can be viewed either as interactive query recommendation systems or as user simulators.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p> The tasks of the Lab can be viewed in the figure below: the development of a Q-agent that produces queries to be submitted to a given retrieval system, and the development of a system that composes the results of the multiple rounds of interactions between the two agents into a single ranking.</p>

		<h3>Collection and Retrieval System</h4>
		<p>The collection that will be used in the 2018 Lab will be the New York Times corpus (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc2008t19). The New York Times dataset consists of articles published in New York Times from January 1, 1987 to June 19, 2007 with metadata provided by the New York Times Newsroom, the New York Times Indexing Service and the online production staff at nytimes.com. Most articles are manually summarized and tagged by professional staffs. The original form of this dataset is in News Industry Text Format (NITF). This dataset can aid the research in Document Categorization, Information Retrieval, Entity Extraction and etc.  The corpus has been indexed by Indri and a Query Language Model with Dirichlet Smoothing has been implemented on the top of the Indri index. Participants will be provided with a RESTful API to query the index (https://bitbucket.org/cvangysel/pyndri-flask)</p>

	<section id="Topics" class="wrapper style1">
  <div class="container">
		<h3>Topics</h4>
		<p>The topics have been developed by the NIST assessors. A topic (which is like a query) contains a few words. It is the main search target for one complete run of dynamic search. Each topic contains multiple subtopics, each of which addresses one aspect of the topic. The NIST assessors have tried (very hard to) produce a complete set of subtopics for each topic, and so we will treat them as the complete set and use them in the interactions and evaluation</p>

				<h3>Task 1: Query Suggestion</h3>
				<h4>Objective:</h4> Given a verbose description of a task generate a sequence of queries and their corresponding rankings of the collection.
				<h4>Submission Guidelines:</h4> Each Q-Agent is allowed to go over 10 rounds of query suggestions. At each round one query is submitted to the A-Agent, and the top 10 results are collected. At the end of round 10, 100 search results will have been collected.
				<h4>Evaluation:</h4> The Cube-Test will be the main evaluation measure, removing the temporal discounting. Other session evaluation measures will also be computed.

				<h3>Task 2: Results Composition</h3>
				<h4>Objective:</h4> Given the ranking in Task 1 merge them in a single composite ranking.
				<h4>Submission Guidelines:</h4>
				<h4>Evaluation:</h4> The nDCG@100 will be the main evaluation measure.
