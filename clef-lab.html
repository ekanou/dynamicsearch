      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Information Retrieval (IR) research has traditionally focused on serving the best results for a single query — so-called ad hoc retrieval. However, users typically search iteratively, refining and reformulating their queries during a session. A key challenge in the study of this interaction is the creation of suitable evaluation resources to assess the effectiveness of retrieval systems over sessions. The TREC Session and Tasks tracks attempted to approach this problem. The same did long time ago the TREC Interactive track. None of the above managed to produce a reusable test collection to evaluate the entire sessions of a conversation between a user and a machine. The problem remains open.</p>
			<p>It has become urgent for the community, and especially forums such as TREC, CLEF, NTCIR to put a focus on and provide such a setup that will put IR at the frontline in developing dynamic systems that better fit the IR needs. The Dynamic Search Lab attempts to construct such reusable test collections and metrics that will allow the development of dynamic search algorithms. The objective of the lab is threefold: 
	 			<ul>
	   			<li>to produce the methodology and algorithms that will lead to a dynamic test collection by simulating the users,</li>
	   			<li>to understand and quantify in terms of evaluation measures what constitutes a good ranking of documents at different stages of a session, and a good overall session</li>
	   			<li>to develop algorithms that can provide an optimal ranking throughout a session.</li>
	 			</ul>
